# Server-Load-Balancer
Server Load Balancer- Round Robin Equall Distribution Method

# Server Load Balancer Algorithm Testing #
# This is Round Robin-Equall Distribution Method #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# To test below code go to the link  https://onlinegdb.com/B1RpAxh1N
#server1=(IP Adress, Port)
#server2=(IP Adress, Port)
#server3=(IP Adress, Port)
#server4=(IP Adress, Port)
#server5=(IP Adress, Port)

# Assume here we have different servers, where their configurations are assigned to variables Server1,Server2 and...so on... 

Servers=['Server1','Server2','Server3','Server4','Server5'] 
# The Servers list having different Servers.
# This program is flexible, You can add Server or remove Server from the list, then no changes required in program. 

counter=0
connection=1
while counter<connection: # There will be n number of connections with Server load balanacer hence we are using while loop.
    for server in Servers: # Every time Server load balancer will choose, one different server from the list hence we are using for loop.
        
        request=input("Request data to Server:   ") # This input is nothing but actual data request from the client.
        print("Your data request:'{}' is conncting to {}.".format(request,server))
        print("Your request is Successfully processed in {}.{}".format(server,'\n')) # Connction is assigning to server of the Servers.
